# Arm-control-interface-design
I used Notepad program to make the robot’s control interface where I used html and for text formatting I used css and js,I designed the interface by placing 6 engines expressing the parts of the robot,on button and a save button then I made a database by installing xampp and then open phpmyadmin to make the base that stores The values ​​of the engines and the save button, where I made only one table that contains all the values ​​that are supposed to be stored which is (6 engines , on , save) where the value of on was previously recorded in the code
Now my interface and database are ready,i will link them to each other beacouse when the user chooses the values ​​from interface will be stored in the database by linking them to php code
